Machine Learning Trading System Basic
=====================================

## What is changed from the original
- Original version is for python 2.6 and (maybe) has some problems
- Convert to python 3.x (tested on 3.6) from Anaconda newest version (2017.3.20)
- Follow the PEP8 (except docstring, variable name length, line limit etc)
- Fix methods definitions and internal logics (cause original is wrong, in my opinion...)
